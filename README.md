# Lane_Detection
This project implements a real-time lane detection system using computer vision techniques in Python. It identifies and highlights lane lines on roads from video input (e.g., dashcam footage), making it suitable for applications in autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).
#  Project Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to identify lane markings on the road from input video frames. This is achieved through a series of image processing steps such as edge detection, region-of-interest selection, and line fitting using the Hough Transform. The system is capable of:
1)Detecting straight or slightly curved lane lines
2)Handling basic lighting and shadow variations
3)Processing each video frame in real-time
4)Overlaying the detected lane lines on the original video feed
